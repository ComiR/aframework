<h2>My jQuery Plug-ins</h2>

<p>Below you'll find a range of different plug-ins for my favourite JS-lib, jQuery.</p>

<p>All the plug-ins are compatible with FF2+, IE7+, Safari 2+, Opera 9+ and Chrome 1+, they have all been validated against <a href="http://jslint.com">JSLint</a> and can stand compression, none of them use any global variables and all of them use 'jQuery' rather than '$'.</p>

<p>There are <?php echo count($plugins); ?> plug-ins to check out at the moment, due to the heavy comment-chunk in the beginning of every file the filesize may be a bit intimidating. Selecting the minified version, however, normally reduces filesize by more than 50%.</p>
